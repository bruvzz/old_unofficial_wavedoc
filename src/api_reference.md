# API REFERENCE
---
Welcome to the reference page for Wave.

- Here, you will be able to see all of the supported functions Wave has built inside of the executor.

Before we start, here are some generics you should probably know when reading a function:

- `union<T, X>` refers to functions that can return more then 1 type for that specific argument/return value.

- `?` refers to optional parameters. 
    - Example: `<bool?>`

- `<void>` refers to functions with no return results (as in other languages)

- `variant` refers to parameters/return values that could be any type.

- `...` refers to variable amounts of parameters/return values.
